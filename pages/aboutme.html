    <h1><i>Who am I?</i></h1>
    <p>I am known as EEKIM10, or EEK. I am a 13 year old bedroom developer, with about as much free time as a donkey.
    I might sound like the sort of person that spends all of his time programming, and thats because I am :D
    <br><br>
    I like to interact with my <a href="https://discord.gg/DJnY6Qw">Discord Server</a> with people who enjoy the projects I've created.
    Come join if you wanna say hello!</p>

  <div id="what-do-I-do" class="box card fancy-card align-right">
    <h1><i>What do I do?</i></h1>
    <p>I create discord bots and games in Python, and try to make websites in HTML, CSS and JS. Pretty simple ngl.
      <br>I have tried creating scripts for a game called "Space Engineers", but that is c# and I can't bend that language like the others.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="what-do-i-use" class="box card fancy-card align-left">
    <h1><i>What do I use?</i></h1>
    <p>I use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">PyCharm Community Edition</a>
      to create things in Python, and I use python3.8 and above. I know (and used to use) py 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7.
      <br>
      In python, I use <code>JSON</code> to store data, so it is human readable and easy to manipulate.
      <br><br>
      To edit HTML, CSS and JS, I used to use
      <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/#section=windows" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">WebStorm</a> but
        the free trial expired and I can't afford the license so I'm back to using
      <a href="https://atom.io/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Atom</a>.
      <br><br>
      To create my YouTube Videos, I use either <a href="https://getsharex.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">ShareX</a> or
      In-built windows 10 game bar recording.
      <br>
      When editing clips together, I use windows video editor (formerly windows movie maker)
      and music from <a href="https://ncsmusic.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">NCS</a>
    </p>

  <div id="why-do-my-projects-take-so-long-to-be-completed" class="box card fancy-card">
    <h1><i>Why do my projects take so long to be completed?</i></h1>
    <p>This is mostly because I'm basically a 1 man dev team! Sure, I have people in
      <a href="https://beta.dragde.xyz/r/server.html" rel="noreferrer">DragDev Studios</a>,
      but they usually have their own projects to work on and I only really ask for help, or if I get stuck.</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>I also maintain a lot of other things, like other people's bots, a minecraft server, a space engineers server,
      I am staff in many servers, usually large, and at the end of the day I get about 3 hours to
      develop stuff.</p>
